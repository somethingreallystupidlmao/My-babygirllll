        <p>But well what's gone is gone I guess. It's such a shame really. Anyway I've been into Howl's Moving Castle so much recently. I relate with Howl on a lot of things. Maybe not the handsome part but aside from that the need to be beautiful on the outside and the tendency to cover up your fears with it. He's a scaredy cat but he's still Howl. I wish I could be like him. Not in the attracting many ladies part. But with the strength of being magical and beautiful, and not letting one's own insecurities define you.</p>
        <p>And out of context I love the way he treats Sophie. Makes me wonder why men don't treat women that way.</p>

        <p class="angel">Wow Goddess. (Ik random)</p>

        <p>Fun fact (Not so fun fact): I actually got I guess molested? Sexually used? I don't know the right term but I'm not strong enough to talk about it today. Regardless that is why I've had a disdain for men too. But it must be weird because I am a man too. Yet I am traumatized from it. And that's why I HATE being compared to men. But Howl is fine. This hatred is probably part of why I'm in the middle of the spectrum between masculinity and feminity as my friends put it. Anyway that's that. I just wanted to open up (lol).</p>

        <p>Anyway I'm just grateful I can tell you all this. You've changed me so much in so many ways and it has always mostly been for the better. I am so grateful that you're alive in this world in the same time as me. I prefer you much more than whatever any other time period could offer. In you, I see the whole universe. And in your eyes, I see my whole life. You're the sweetest and the most precious soul I know. I'll always be there for when you're hurt or down. You're everything I've ever wanted, needed and received. I don't feel the need for a gift because you're the greatest gift God could have sent.</p>

        <p>In conclusion, regardless of how the Earth rotates or revolves, or how society transforms, or how the economy comes crashing down, or how the ice caps start melting, I will always have affection for you.</p>

        <p>I love you, Christine.</p>

        <p class="ps">P.S. Here are some pictures of me that I thought you'd like.</p>
