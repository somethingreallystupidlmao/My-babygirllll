            <p>However I'm obviously myself insecure with regards to me. I am taya. But I have a lot of things I'm hiding. I do not have any achievements to my name yet. And I'm still searching for the person that I am to become tomorrow. It is tiring and that's particularly why I'm insecure. There's not much a lot other stuff I'm insecure about. I do regret not getting my brother to study in our school and that maybe I could have done more. But helpless as I am, I'm forced to believe that there was not anything I could do. All I can hope for is to be a good big brother to my own little brother. And a good son. And a good boyfriend, partner, whatever. Those are the only roles that will ever matter to me of the innumerable ones I play in this life.</p>
