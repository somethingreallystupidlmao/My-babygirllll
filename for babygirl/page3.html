            <p>And I guess we both know what happened next after all the sunshine and rainbows. It was pretty sad to separate after being so close to you. I felt like I lost myself somewhere. You were still a part of me. I did not want to let go. And I tried. But seeing you with other people just made me insecure. I was sad because we never behaved with a certain degree of comfort we should have. I was heartbroken. It killed me to be me.</p>
            <p>And sometimes it still does. I still do get insecure at times. Not being with you has always felt like the end of the world. And at this point it probably is. It hurts thinking. And it hurts because I've felt this way before. It's from that period of my life that I grew sensitive to things. And that's probably why recently I've become such a dirtbag. And I got angry all those times recently because I felt I deserve at least to be treated better for all the loving I did. And yes I still am insecure about a lot of things. There's obviously the fate of not being together after a while looming over us like death itself. And that is why I have the tendency to be clingy. To be separated from you is my worst nightmare and honestly right now, I'm not even prepared for it. My deepest insecurities consist of thoughts like "What if she finds another guy better than me?","Am I even that relevant?","She does find other guys attractive too."</p>
